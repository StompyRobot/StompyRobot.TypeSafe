1.4.0
----------

New:
- Converted package to use .asmdefs instead of pre-compiled DLLs.

Fixed:
- (1.4.1) Scenes now included correctly in generated scene list.

1.3.2
----------

New:
- Added missing overloads for Object.Instantiate in PrefabResource.

1.3.1
----------

New:
- Support for Audio Mixers parameters and snapshots.
- Support for Animator parameters and layers.
- Added checkboxes in advanced tab for disabling individual data sources.

Changes:
- Minimum supported Unity version is now 5.4.
- Unity 4 is no longer supported.
- Custom asset type cache is now stored separately from settings so it can be excluded from source control.

1.2.2
----------

Changes:
- Textures set to the "Sprite" import mode will now use the Sprite type in resources.
- Changes to assets in blacklist no longer trigger automatic scan.
- When whitelist is enabled, changes to assets not in whitelist no longer trigger automatic scan.
- Items in blacklist/not in whitelist no longer have heavy processing (should speed up scan time significantly on large projects).
- Custom asset types are now cached so subsequent scans are faster.

1.2.1
----------

Changes:
- Menu items are no longer specified in the .dll file, instead are located in TypeSafe/Editor/MenuItems.cs to allow for user customisation.
- No longer aborts compile process if a C#-safe name for a resource cannot be found, instead skips and prints a compile error.
- Added "Start Scan" button to settings window.

Fixes:
- Resources with a custom type that is 'private' are now declared as 'internal' to prevent "Inconsistent accessibility" errors.

----------

New:

- 'Whitelist' mode allows you to specify only the folders/assets you want to include.

- Customise the output directory from the settings window.

Improvements:
- Settings window updated with new layout, added changelog tab to welcome window.

- (Mac) Prevent settings asset from being overridden when reimporting project.

1.1.1
----------

New:
- Added Unload() method to resources.

Improvements:
